# Why we need nanoid
Each time we pass the props item in a component, it generates a child element. 
React needs a unique key to uniquely distinguish these child elements.
npm install nanoid

# To build and run a React application, follow these steps:
Step 1: Install dependencies  
npm install  
Step 2: Build the application:  
npm run build
Step 3: Serve the built application locally
npm start
This command will start a development server, and your React application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
